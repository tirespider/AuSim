Intro to AuSim

Here are some estimated statistics that might describe a
typical CCTA player:

    Has been playing for 3 years
    Plays 280 days per year
    Plays on 2 servers at once
    Attacks 6 targets per day on each server
    Spends 5 minutes in simulation per target
    Performs 12 unit swaps per minute
    Clicks twice per swap.
    
The significance of those numbers is this:
  3 x 280 x 2 x 6 x 5 x 12 x 2 = 1,209,600 clicks. 
The human hand is a mechanical device. As such, 
it is subject to wear and tear that cannot easily, or
cheaply, be repaired once damage is done. Many people
are diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrom and related
conditions resulting from overuse of their wrist, hands
or fingers.  For these people, using their hands for
everyday tasks can be difficult and painful. To offset
their pain they may require prescription drugs or surgery.
It would be far better had they known of the damage they 
were subjecting themselves to before finding it out too late.

AwSim is for those who already feel the effects of hand
damage and regret that it leaves them unable to fully
participate in the experience of playing CCTA. AwSim is
also for those who play CCTA and wish to take steps now
to avoid having hand problems later.  

1,209,600 is not a small number. By one estimate that 100g
of force is exerted with each mouse click, the cumulative 
total is the equivilent of lifting a weight of 120 tons once. 
Whether you click a mouse button over a million times or lift 
a whale with one finger just one time in your life, it is bound 
to have consequences. Let AwSim bear that burden and give your 
clicking hand a much deserved respite.

As you use AwSim, don't expect to be able to sim faster, or 
get better results or make your RT last longer.  But if you 
should find that to be true, consider it as your hands' 
indirect way of thanking you for your attention to it's
health and well being. 

EA has not made a statement one way or the other about
the use of AwSim. However, if it should be declared anything
but acceptable there are a good many attorneys who play
CCTA who would look forward to the opportunity to pursue
a legal opinion prohibiting any restriction of the use of
AwSim under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1992,
a United Stated federal law.
